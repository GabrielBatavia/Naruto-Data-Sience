More often than employing his hands, B would wield his blades in and between various parts of his body. The first two are held in the hinge joint of his right and left arm, another between his shoulder blade and neck, one in his mouth, under his left armpit, another between the hip joint of his right, raised leg and the back leg of the same raised leg. As strange as it seems, Killer B is extremely skilled with these blades and this fighting style which he began adopting since a young age.[3] The most dangerous aspect of this style is the unpredictability of his movements, easily catching his opponents by surprise. He can spin in a manner similar to a buzz-saw, or else employing a series of unrelenting attacks switching the locations as well as the blades with which he attacks, leaving no openings for even a skilled Sharingan user like Sasuke Uchiha,[4] and a highly trained swordsman like Suigetsu H\u014dzuki, who remarked that the method of attack was completely unpredictable.[5] Killer B was also able to throw these swords from their normally awkward positions, either to hit his opponents from range, or to impale his opponent at close range and cause damage that would normally be lethal.[6]\nThe swords can be charged with lightning chakra to greatly increase their cutting power through high-frequency vibrations.[7] Because of the streamline shape of these swords, they serve as fairly good projectiles as well.[8] In the anime Killer B was able to use the Eight-Tails' tentacle to extend his reach for a surprise attack.[9]"}

Users control the chains as they extend outwards from their body, most commonly to wrap around targets and restrain them.[2] The chains are extremely durable, enough that even the Nine-Tails would struggle to destroy them.[1] In the anime, in addition to physically binding targets, the chains are said to neutralise their target by binding and nullifying their chakra.[3] Depending on the number and the length of chains that users intend to produce, they may prefer to initially create only a few chains, which they send underground to split apart and spread around the area as needed, leaving their immediate surroundings uncluttered.[4]\n\nThe chains creating a barrier.The chains binding the Nine-Tails within Kushina's subconscious.1/2\nA barrier can be erected between two or more sealing chains, which is quite impregnable: Kushina Uzumaki creates such a barrier to not only prevent the Nine-Tails from escaping a defined area, but also to prevent the Third Hokage from entering it.[5] Because the chains are made of the user's chakra, the chains can be produced anywhere the user's chakra resides. When she was the Nine-Tails' jinch\u016briki, Kushina used the chains to bind the Nine-Tails within her subconscious,[6] and for this reason she never once lost control of its power.[1] After her death, some of Kushina's chakra was sealed within her son, Naruto Uzumaki, allowing her to produce the chains from his body in order to help him combat the Nine-Tails.[2]\nDuring the Fourth Shinobi World War, Karin awakens the ability to produce similar chains, which she uses to lash against and ultimately destroy a wooden opponent. Orochimaru labels this the same ability as Kushina possessed,[7] but Jin no Sho describes it only as a \"glimpse\" of Kushina's Adamantine Sealing Chains.[1]\n\nSee Also[]\nBeast Sealing Technique\nDemonic Statue Chains\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 Jin no Sho, page 253\n\n\u2191 2.0 2.1 Naruto chapter 498\n\n\u2191 Naruto: Shipp\u016bden episode 408\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 503\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 504\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 501\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 663"}

Each is capable of tracking their intended target and producing a significant explosion proportional to size upon contact but as they emerge, they consume a substantial amount of clay from the original dragon, initially extracting it from the creature's tail. This ultimately limits the number that each C2 \"Dragon\" is capable of creating, before clay must be sacrificed from more vital areas, such as the body or wings. By using more clay, the missile's size and explosive power can be substantially increased.\nThe dragon can also produce clay mines at the expense of clay, that take the form of small spherical creatures, which can be subsequently manipulated to force opponents to fight in a limited space.

Understanding this theory, the Body Revival Technique can repair the user's body and increase its strength by manipulating the \"Destruction and Rebirth\" cycle of the muscles.\nThis technique allows the user to survive any otherwise normally fatal damage and instantly heal from the damage. A unique trait of this technique is that it can momentarily give the user the appearance of death, fooling even the most talented medical-nins.\nWhen combined with Dark Chakra, this technique can also be used to physically enhance the person's speed, strength and healing capabilities to superhuman levels. It also alters the person's physical appearance drastically, making them younger and more fit in looks, greatly bulking their muscular physique. By Shinn\u014d's claim, this form allows him to perform techniques that are normally taxing for the body, including open all Eight Gates, without any drawbacks. However, if the user loses proper control over the dark chakra while performing this technique, it can cause severe backlash that can destroy the body."}

If users are fast enough, they can use this brief lapse in the opponent's attentions to stage a counterattack;[1] in the anime, the replacement log itself has been shown used as an attack, being applied with explosive tags.[2] Alternatively, this is a good opportunity for users to escape.[1]\nThe Body Replacement Technique can evidently only be used in response to what would be harmful attacks: Pain only escapes from Jiraiya's Wild Lion's Mane Technique when Jiraiya tries to kill him with it; when Jiraiya uses the same technique to only keep Pain restrained, Pain remains captured.[3]"}
{"jutsu_name": "Body Recreation Technique", "jutsu_type": "Ninjutsu, Clone Techniques", "jutsu_description": "Kabuto uses specially-developed snakes to execute the process of recreation and multiplication of another being's cells to create a living clone of them\u2014a process which requires the DNA of the intended target. The spring water produced by The Hole appears to catalyse and speed up the recreation process because of the large \"life force\" flowing through it.[1] The downside to the accelerated rate at which the clone matures is that the snakes composing it have a very short lifespan, resulting in the clone splitting apart and dying after approximately 48 hours.[2]\nOnce the clone is created, Kabuto is able to gain control of it by placing a special talisman into its head. Depending on the talisman used, the clone can either become a mindless tool under Kabuto's control, with eyes possessing black sclera and white irides, or allowed to access their genetic source's personality and memories, while possessing eyes with dark grey sclera and white, snake-like irides. Clones produced through this method are also able to use any abilities possessed by their original selves, including those that they did not naturally acquire.[3] While not in battle, Kabuto stored the clones he created within large snakes, which would burst out of the ground and release their contents when needed.\nKabuto first used this technique to create a clone of Akatsuki member Hidan by placing snakes containing his DNA into the water produced by The Hole, causing them to quickly form into a humanoid shape, and then giving it life with a talisman. Later, snakes which had been ingested by Naruto Uzumaki created a clone of him upon exiting his body; a process which had greatly weakened him over the course of a day and ultimately paralysed him. Unlike the clone of Hidan, this clone did not require the insertion of a talisman to gain life and, due to the influence of Kurama's chakra, was formed in Naruto's four-tailed Version 2 state and possessed a strangely coloured body as well as a tail. The clone was also capable of resisting the control of Kabuto's talisman once it was inserted.[3]"}

Tsunade creates an electric field by giving her chakra the properties of electricity. When she strikes a target with her hand, the electricity pours into their nervous system and rearranges their body's signals. Ordinarily, the brain sends electric signals to the body to control how it moves. But when under the influence of this technique, these signals will produce any movement other than what the brain intends. When used against most opponents, they will be unable to do something as simple as walking, much less continue fighting.[1]\nThe target can partially overcome this technique if they manage to relearn the connection between their brain and their limbs, as Kabuto Yakushi demonstrates.

This allows him to escape from bindings and regenerate from attacks. Due to these resulting trails of fluid, Kabuto can inhibit sensing techniques from detecting him, such as d\u014djutsu.

The cause of the illness is first determined by perceiving disturbances in the patient's chakra. Then, using a chakra scalpel, an incision is made near the affected part. Using their chakra, the medical-nin pushes a large volume of a medicinal fluid through the incision. The fluid then draws the poison out of the affected part(s) and serves as a medium through which the poison is suspended and then forced out of the person's body. This technique thus removes the poison, while simultaneously repairing the damage caused by the poison. The process itself is extremely painful and requires the subject to be restrained in order for the process to work. As such, it is considered a rather crude method to deal with pathogens and toxins, and only used in emergency. This technique only draws out most of the poison, not all of it, so the subject can potentially still be in danger, albeit not immediate. To fully treat the subject, an antidote is needed.\nAfter the agent is drawn out, it can be used to create an antidote or medicine after it has been analysed. This can then be given to the patient to ensure a complete recovery. This technique requires the utmost care and ability in diagnosis, incising and unmatched chakra control. Therefore, it is considered an extremely difficult technique, even among medical-nin."}

{"jutsu_name": "Dead Demon Consuming Seal", "jutsu_type": "Ninjutsu, F\u016binjutsu, Kinjutsu", "jutsu_description": "The Dead Demon Consuming Seal is a sealing technique developed by the Uzumaki clan to call upon the power of the Shinigami.[2] Its very existence is so secret that even Orochimaru knew nothing about it.[1]\n\nOverview[]\nAfter the hand seals are performed, the user's soul is partly separated from their body and suspended behind them. Behind their soul appears the Shinigami, which restrains their soul with its hair. Only the summoner is able to see the Shinigami at this point. After a few moments,[3] the Shinigami wraps its left arm with prayer beads and chants unintelligibly until a cursed seal appears on its arm. It then drives its arm into the summoner's soul, thus allowing the summoner to call upon the Shinigami to seal a target: the Shinigami's arm emerges from the summoner's body and grasps the target's soul.[1] When Hiruzen Sarutobi performs it, he is required to get close to his target in order to initiate the seal.[3] When Minato Namikaze performs it, he is able to remain at a distance.[4] Targets are able to see the Shinigami so long as it's in contact with their soul.[5]\nWhile the Shinigami grabs their soul, the target is immobilised, any jutsu they may be using are dispelled,[3] and they are prevented from performing additional jutsu.[5] With targets unable to escape or fight back, the summoner can remove and seal their soul. Hiruzen was able to seal multiple souls by using this technique in conjunction with the Shadow Clone Technique.[3] The sealing, however, is not necessarily complete nor automatic:\n\nWhen Minato uses it, he seals only the Nine-Tails' yin chakra, leaving its yang chakra alone.[6]\nWhen Hiruzen used it on Orochimaru, he had to rely on his own physical strength to extract Orochimaru's soul.[5] Because he lacked the strength to fully remove it,[7] he opted instead to only seal Orochimaru's arms, accomplished by having the Shinigami cut off the arms of Orochimaru's soul.[8]\nThe target's soul is sealed within the body of the summoner, represented by a swirl pattern on their torso that is similar in appearance to the Eight Trigrams Sealing Style.[3] In Minato's case, this sealing of the Nine-Tails' yin chakra into himself makes him its jinch\u016briki.[9] With the sealing completed, the Shinigami gradually starts consuming the summoner's soul.[8] The summoner can, with difficulty, continue moving and speaking, allowing them to finish any lingering business they may have, but they will die as soon as their soul has been fully consumed.[4] The souls of the summoner and their victim do not pass on to the Pure Land,[10] instead being trapped within the Shinigami's stomach, destined to fight each other for all eternity.[5]\nAlthough Orochimaru survives the sealing of his arms, his arms are paralysed, causing them to hang uselessly at his sides. This prevents him from performing hand seals and by extension most ninjutsu.[8] With time, he's able to regain limited use of the arms, but he's still left with a constant and extreme pain.[11] Orochimaru believes that Tsunade could heal his arms - something Tsunade does not deny - but she refuses to help him.[12] Ultimately, after his arms begin to rot, Orochimaru is forced to switch bodies or risk death.[13] He is able to make better use of the new body's arms,[14] but the jutsu he can use remain limited so long as his soul's arms are sealed within the Shinigami.[15]\n\n    Souls being released from the Shinigami's stomach.  \nSouls can only be freed from the Shinigami's stomach by using Dead Demon Consuming Seal: Release (\u5c4d\u9b3c\u5c01\u5c3d\u30fb\u89e3, Shiki F\u016bjin: Kai, English TV: Reaper Death Seal: Release). To use, an individual wears the Shinigami Mask, causing them to become possessed by the Shinigami. If the individual wearing the mask slices open their own stomach, the Shinigami will do the same, and any souls inside it will be freed. However, the mask doesn't have any properties that will prevent its user from dying of that injury; when Orochimaru uses this to restore his arms, he survives the injury by switching bodies once again. With the other souls he frees from the Shinigami, Orochimaru is able to use the Impure World Reincarnation.[15]"}

The seal was applied on the left side of the back of both Sasuke's and Anko's necks.\nAnko received her cursed seal when she was a student of Orochimaru. She, along with nine others, were the first people to receive a cursed seal. She was the only one to survive the application, establishing the one-in-ten success rate for the procedure. Because she lacked the will to use it, her seal receded, and (in the anime) Orochimaru wiped her memory. Orochimaru was able to briefly reactivate the seal when they fought in the Forest of Death before the Third Hokage sealed it off again. It was fully removed when Sasuke used it as a medium to revive Orochimaru's consciousness and body via the Evil Releasing Method.[2]\n\n     Sasuke receives curse seal.  \nOrochimaru branded Sasuke with the cursed seal in the second phase of the Ch\u016bnin Exams, which took place in the Forest of Death. Orochimaru intended to have the seal corrode Sasuke's mind so that he could become his next body. Kakashi Hatake used the Evil Sealing Method to try and prevent this, but its effectiveness relied on Sasuke's choosing not to use his cursed seal. Sasuke ultimately chose to advance his seal to its second level, and went to Orochimaru with the help of the Sound Four. \nWhen Sasuke activated the second level of the seal, his skin turned dark-grey and his hair grew and turned dark blue. His eyes also turned dark grey. Additionally, he grew webbed-claw-shaped wings from his back which he could use to fly and glide, and a dark, star-shaped mark appeared across the bridge of his nose. Should any limbs be lost, Sasuke is able to replace them with snakes. During Sasuke's battle with Itachi Uchiha, he lost the cursed seal, along with Orochimaru (having earlier been absorbed into Sasuke's body), as they were removed with the Sword of Totsuka.\nAccording to Kabuto, the seal itself contains Orochimaru's chakra, which Kabuto used in order to improve the binding power of Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation. In fact, when Orochimaru was defeated, his consciousness remained split amongst the cursed seals, and Sasuke used that, along with a piece of Kabuto's modified flesh, to bring the former back to his original state and mind.[2]\n\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 199, pages 2-3\n\n\u2191 2.0 2.1 Naruto chapter 593, page 9"}

The seal is located of the upper portion of Kimimaro's chest over his manubrium. When the first level is activated, the seal turns orange-red and expands in lines spreading all over Kimimaro's body in contorting and parallel lines. When the second level of the seal is active, Kimimaro takes on a dinosaur-like appearance complete with a tail. Several large bones also protrude from his darkened skin and gains four distinguishing figures: two dark black curved like markings under his eyes - one under each eye and two as elongated eyebrows - one above each eye.\n\nUsage[]\nThis cursed seal is particularly strong even amongst the other already powerful cursed seals with Kimimaro being the only known user and with the Cursed Seal of Heaven standing as its only equal. Like all cursed seals, Kimimaro receives increased chakra levels, physical capabilities and his ninjutsu skills become more effective when the seal is active. The second level also increases his healing might, as his torn flesh was instantly restored upon his transformation.\nKimimaro must enter his second level in order to properly use the Dance of the Clematis: Flower, due to the resultant weapon's size and density.[1] In his second level, he can also merge with the bone blades created by his Dance of the Seedling Fern, allowing him to launch a deadly surprise attack at his target's blindspot.[2]\n\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 T\u014d no Sho, page 257\n\n\u2191 T\u014d no Sho, page 227"}

It also has the advantage of being able to be used for surprise attacks and capturing. \nWhen the enemy's body is pierced, the user can alter the spear's shape into multiple additional blades, increasing the number of wounds.[4] The blade can also be swung in order to cut things as well as cause fatal injuries. Sasuke has shown that he can also channel this technique through his chokut\u014d.[5]\nBecause of Sasuke's mastery in kenjutsu, this technique can act as a makeshift sword if he loses his sword.\nAfter infusing this technique with Six Paths Chakra, Sasuke was able to bisect through the revived Madara in his jinch\u016briki form.[6]"}

By pointing his finger out at a target and writing the proper kanji in the air, this technique produces a variety of effects. \n\nKnown Words[]\nThe effects of these kanji have been shown:\n\n\u64cd, which comes from the verb \u64cd\u308b (ayatsuru), meaning \"to manipulate\".

The effect manifests when Shiranami writes the kanji in the air at the target's direction; at which point, the kanji appears on the recipient's person. That individual then becomes a subject to Shiranami's will. However, as with the Infinite Embrace, it is not absolute, since a person with tremendous chakra can easily dispel the effect.\n\u6ec5, which comes from the verb \u6ec5\u3059\u308b (messuru), meaning \"to destroy\". Shiranami uses this character to track down and destroy a message sent by carrier pigeon. Utakata destroyed the word before it could fulfil its purpose.\n\u5ca9 (iwa, rock). This character allows Shiranami to immobilise targets. In the case of clones, this dispels them.\n\u7206 (baku, explode). This character causes several explosions that can also be used to dispel clones.\n\u706b (hi, fire). This character creates a blaze of fire, which can vary in size.\n\u708e (en, flames). This character creates a large wall of fire to keep the enemies away.\n\u65ac (zan), which comes from the verb \u65ac\u308b (kiru), meaning \"to kill with a blade\".

{"jutsu_name": "Chakra Transfer Technique", "jutsu_type": "Ninjutsu, Chakra Flow, Ninsh\u016b", "jutsu_description": "This technique allows the user to transfer their chakra to a target. The amount of chakra transferred depends solely on the user.\n\nOverview[]\nThis technique was originally created by Hagoromo \u014ctsutsuki in order to \"connect\" the spiritual energies of every living person. His intention was for it to be used to build and maintain peace through his religion of ninsh\u016b, but this technique ended up becoming another tool for war when humanity weaponised chakra. This technique is used by many shinobi, each one of them has shown to use technique in different ways. \n\nVariations[]\nCertain people, such as\u00a0Minato Namikaze and Naruto Uzumaki could also mould the transferred chakra in order to adapt it to another person's specific chakra type.[1] In the latter's case, due to Kurama's chakra, it also enveloped the recipients in a chakra cloak similar to his \"Version 1\" form, albeit with no tails.[2] Once the user transfers its chakra, he/she is able to manipulate that chakra remotely.\nKatsuyu and its summoners have a unique bond between them through Strength of a Hundred Seal and they can use Katsuyu: Immense Network Healing. Tsunade used this technique during Pain's invasion of Konoha, with Tsunade first transferring her healing chakra to Katsuyu, and then Katsuyu itself transferring it to the wounded villagers. Sakura used the same method of Tsunade with Katsuyu to heal wounded shinobi in Shinobi Alliance against Ten-Tails.[3]\nTsunade used again this technique during the five Kage's fight against Madara Uchiha to give \u014cnoki some of her chakra so that he could use a massive Dust Release: Detachment of the Primitive World Technique to defeat Madara's wood clones.[4] Sakura later used this technique to improve Obito's Kamui.\nZetsu's Spore Technique creates clones, which feed on chakra to grow are also able to transfer chakra to people they come in contact with.[5]\nDan Kat\u014d was able to use this technique as a spirit in Tsunade's consciousness to restore her chakra and Strength of a Hundred Seal.[6] Obito did something similar to give his chakra and d\u014djutsu powers to Kakashi after his body had been turned to ashes.[7]\nJ\u016bgo was able to transfer natural energy to someone thanks to his clan's unique ability.[8][9]\nTailed beasts are also able to freely share their chakra with whoever they choose, and as Kurama has noted, it is a less complicated process for them than it is for humans.[10][11]\nSamehada was able to absorb and transfer chakra to its wielder. It was also able to transfer chakra from Kisame back to Killer B.[12][13]\nHagoromo \u014ctsutsuki was the first user of this technique to connect all humans living in the earth and gave the chakra to humanity besides his immediate family.[14] Hagoromo also used this technique inside of Naruto and Sasuke who are the reincarnations of Asura and Indra. He gave the power to them to defeat Madara. While using this technique, a unique entity appears behind Hagoromo with a marking reminiscent of a third eye in its forehead.[15]\nIn the anime, if the Aburame member has proper control, the kikaich\u016b are also shown able to transfer their accumulated chakra to others targets, replenishing them.[16]\nIn the anime, the Magaki Group uses this technique in a different way. First Nang\u014d sends his chakra to Benten and Ch\u016bshin, and then both of them send it along with its own to Akaboshi, greatly enhancing the power of his techniques.[17] He is able to shatter a barrier easily with his increased chakra.\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 617, page 5\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 616\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 634, pages 7-8\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 588, pages 13-15\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 466, pages 9-11\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 591, page 16\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 688, page 2\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 413, page 15\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 618, page 13\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 572, page 10\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 609, pages 13-14\n\n\u2191 \"Naruto\" chapter 471, page 14\n\n\u2191 \"Naruto\" chapter 472, page 16\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 665, page 6\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 671, pages 14-16\n\n\u2191 Naruto: Shipp\u016bden episode 304\n\n\u2191 Naruto: Shipp\u016bden episode 144"}

However, due to having one's chakra suppressed, they will be unable to use jutsu.\nThe \u014ctsutsuki Clan can naturally suppress their chakra signature. A vessel which been has sufficiently changed into an \u014ctsutsuki can access this ability on instinct, without being consciously aware of its existence.

Because of this requirement, using the chakra scalpel offensively is highly unusual. In heated combat, even the greatest medical-nin won't be able to exert the precision needed to target the vital spots, but it can still effectively cut muscle tissues and tendons, rendering the target immobile.\nKabuto has displayed enough skill with the technique to be able to deliver fatal cuts that can target vital spots, even cutting through wood and flesh with ease.

These additional appendages, as well as the user's body as a whole, are augmented with a variety of mechanical weaponry, which they can access at will. The user can fire their forearms as long-range projectiles or pull them off to reveal and fire a cluster of segmented missiles at targets. They are also able to protrude a set of flexible blades and drills or a series of mechanical tendrils from their arms, as well as quickly propel themselves forward by emitting a burst of chakra from holes in their feet. The user can also release a powerful chakra blast, which is capable of destroying numerous buildings at once, either by transforming one of their hands into a cannon or by opening the crown of their head.\nThe body through which Nagato channelled the Asura Path displayed enough raw physical power to rip Jiraiya's arm off and crush his throat with basic taijutsu, as well as to throw the Animal Path all the way into Konohagakure from the outskirts of the village. Additionally, the Asura Path was able to survive otherwise fatal damage due to its mechanised insides. All of these abilities befitted the \"warring demon\" name that the Asura Path held, whilst giving it a considerable degree of versatility.\n\n\nMechanisms[]\nThe detached hand being launched.As displayed through Nagato's Path, not only was the arm detachable, but a cluster of segmented missiles produced from within it.The arm itself could be used as a launching pad to launch the missiles.The Path's head opening up to reveal a cannon.The Path being propelled with mechanisms from the feet. The right hand also shows additional weapons being produced.Additional arms being equipped in battle.\nInfluences[]\nIn Buddhism, the Asura realm is the plane of semi-divine warring demons which people are reincarnated in due to actions based on jealousy, struggle, combat or rationalisation in a previous life, and though powerful, live in constant violence and conflict to which there is no resolution nor peace. Following a common depiction of Asura, this ability allows the user to possess six arms and three faces, each of which display a different emotion. Like Deva, Asura are also a race of supernatural beings. They are also featured in Hinduism as divine beings, and are known to live a life pursuing power, while indulgent and representative of materialistic and carnal pleasures. Both depictions play in the abilities of the Asura Path.\nIt also draws inspiration from Hinduism, where Asuras in mythology purportedly had the ability (called Astra) to use magical equivalents to modern day biological missiles.\n\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 Fourth Databook, page 257\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 551, page 6"}

It has the same five second limit as the Shinra Tensei as stated by Ch\u014dji Akimichi.[2] The area of effect can be localised, so it is possible to selectively attract a target or targets without affecting the object or the structure they're connected to.[3][4] It is also possible to attract multiple targets at once, causing them to collide with each other.[4] The ability to manipulate attractive forces with this technique is granted by the Deva Path much like its counterpart Shinra Tensei.\n\nOther Media[]\nAn enhanced, \"Full Throttle\" version of Bansh\u014d Ten'in appears in Naruto Shipp\u016bden: Shinobi Rumble, called \"Bansh\u014d Ten'in: D\u014dmetsu\" (\u4e07\u8c61\u5929\u5f15\u30fb\u5c0e\u6ec5, literally meaning: Heavenly Attraction of All Creation: Guiding Destruction).\nIn Naruto Shipp\u016bden: Ultimate Ninja Impact, Nagato can also use it to lift the ground and throw it at the opponent, called \"Bansh\u014d Ten'in: Jid\u014d\" (\u4e07\u8c61\u5929\u5f15\u30fb\u5730\u52d5, literally meaning: Heavenly Attraction of All Creation: Ground Motion).\n\nInfluence[]\nThe names of Bansh\u014d Ten'in and its companion ability, Shinra Tensei, are derived from Shinra Bansh\u014d (\u795e\u7f85\u4e07\u8c61, literally meaning: Everything Covered by God), a Japanese four-character idiom and homophone variant of Shinra Bansh\u014d (\u68ee\u7f85\u4e07\u8c61, literally meaning: All-Covering Forests and Ten Thousand Things), a Buddhist idiom which has come to mean \"All Nature\" or \"All Creation\"."}

Because Amenominaka works on everybody in the vicinity of Kaguya, she cannot use it to escape from attackers or to transport only certain individuals to other dimensions; for both purposes, she instead relies on Yomotsu Hirasaka.[5] Kaguya does seem to have some control over where she and the others will appear within a dimension, giving her a strategic option: when first depicted, she shifts high into the air of her lava dimension, leaving her opponents to fall into the molten sea below;[2] when she is being attacked by Naruto Uzumaki and Sasuke Uchiha, she shifts to a part of her ice dimension that places Naruto and Sasuke within a glacier, trapping them and thus stopping their attack.[5]\nWhen Kakashi Hatake first experiences Amenominaka, he believes it is the result of a genjutsu because of how suddenly it happens and how stark the change is from where he was (Earth). It is only from noticing that the new world is too vast in size and intricate in detail that he realises it cannot be a mere illusion.[2] He nevertheless revisits the genjutsu comparison later, noting that - from his perspective - Kaguya seems to be instantly rewriting reality with each use of Amenominaka.[5]"}

Next, Suna-nin would use their Wind Release: Air Current Wild Dance to manipulate the dust to further obscure the Uchiha's vision, while Aburame clan members and Kiri-nin would use their Insect Jamming Technique and Hiding in Mist Technique to impair their sensory skills. \nThe second step, to restrain the Ten-Tails, would see the Iwa-nin create a large sink hole with their Earth Release: Great Moving Earth Core, with their lava users covering the beast with quicklime, mixing it with the Kiri-nin's water.

When the fabrications decided to take matters into their own hands, the Akuta produced even went against \u014cnoki's orders.\n\nDevelopment[]\n\u014cnoki created this technique in response to a missing-nin's attack claiming the lives of many young shinobi.
